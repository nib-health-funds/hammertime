Serverless power cycling for AWS EC2 instances and Auto Scaling Groups based on a schedule.

![Stop! Hammer Time!](hammertime.gif)

## Getting Started

Edit [serverless.yml](serverless.yml) where you can adjust
* scheduled run time,
* deployment s3 bucket (can be set as `DEPLOY_BUCKET` env var),
* AWS region,
* stage between dev/test/production/other (can be set as `SLICE` env var),
* anything else which takes your fancy.

## Usage

To stop hammertime
* killing your EC2 instance tag with `hammertime:canttouchthis`
* spinning your ASG down to 0 tag the ASG with `hammertime:canttouchthis`

`stop-hammertime` will stop all EC2 instances that are not tagged with `hammertime:canttouchthis` and are not in an ASG. It will also set the desired instance count of all ASGs not tagged likewise to 0.

`start-hammertime` will query the tags left by `stop-hammertime` and return the instances and ASGs to their previous status.

Hammertime is intended to be run in response to a Lambda scheduled event, e.g

`stop-hammertime`: run Monday-Friday at 6PM
`start-hammertime`: run Monday-Friday at 6AM

Note when constructing schedule events in AWS, that times are in UTC.

## Deployment

Refer to the [serverless framework](!https://serverless.com/) for detailed instructions, but should be as simple as

* Install dependencies

```
npm i
```

* Authenticate with AWS via your favourite CLI

* then deploy

```
npm deploy
```

## Built With

* [serverless framework](!https://serverless.com/)
